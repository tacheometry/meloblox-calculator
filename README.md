### ðŸŒ± Roots

It all started with an Early Access game on Roblox called MeloBlox from an amazing developer Poinball. The game is pretty grindy and our goal after tens of hours spent in the game was to give the community a tool to approximate their loot.


### ðŸŒ³ __Progress__

Currently we are working on the web app giving the WOW feeling and easy access to the calculations.
